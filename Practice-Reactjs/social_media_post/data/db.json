It’s usually a couple of sentences long, and tells the searcher what they need to know about what the page contains and how relevant it might be to their query.\n\nIn other words, it’s a big part of the reason why a user might decide to click – or not click – on your page in search, and it’s also the first touchpoint that they have with your brand.\n\nNeedless to say, it’s worth making it count."
